# Project 404: Crafting a Developer-Friendly AI Chatbot

**Introduction**

Building an AI chatbot tailored to developers is no small feat. With Project 404, the vision was clear: create a developer-friendly tool that not only integrates advanced features but also demonstrates scalable, modern web practices. Here’s an insider’s look at the journey, challenges, and solutions that made Project 404 a reality.

**The Vision for Project 404**

At its core, Project 404 was designed to be more than just another chatbot. It had to meet key developer-centric criteria:

1. **Persistence:** Users can store and revisit conversations.
2. **Scalability:** A solid architecture to handle evolving requirements.
3. **Developer-first Features:** Adjustable AI parameters, like OpenAI’s temperature setting, and accessible UX.

**Technical Highlights**

- **Authentication:** Combined Firebase Anonymous Authentication with GitHub OAuth for flexible user management.
- **Backend:** A MongoDB database with Mongoose for robust storage of conversations and user preferences.
- **Frontend:** Built with React and Chakra UI, ensuring a clean, accessible interface.
- **API Integration:** Leveraged OpenAI’s API with configurable options like token count and temperature for developer experimentation.

**Challenges and Solutions**

1. **Authentication Complexity:** Mixing Firebase Anonymous Authentication and GitHub OAuth required careful state management.
    - *Solution:* Centralized authentication logic and kept UI states independent.
2. **Conversation Persistence:** Linking multiple logins to the same user profile was tricky.
    - *Solution:* Implemented UID arrays and merging logic for seamless conversation continuity.
3. **UI Design:** Ensuring the interface was professional yet simple to navigate.
    - *Solution:* Leveraged Chakra UI components for modular and responsive design.

**Takeaways**

Project 404 demonstrated the power of combining robust technologies with thoughtful design. By focusing on the user’s journey and prioritizing flexibility, it became a tool developers could rely on and learn from.
